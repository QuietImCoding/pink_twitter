Pink twitter css stylesheet 

## How to use

well... its css so u can use it a bunch of ways. BUT! If you're using the arc browser and want to set it up as a boost: 

- Make sure Arc is up to date, since this is a new feature
- Navigate to Twitter
- Press CMD+E to bring up the command pallette
- Type New Boost
- Choose "Style" in the menu
- Copy paste the contents of styles.css into the editor that shows up
- Voila, Twitter should refresh and look absolutely abhorrent
